## STUNTMAN MIKE

IP - 10.150.150.166
OS - LINUX
DIFFICULTY - EASY

### Nmap scan

we have two open ports

let's start enumeration from port 22
bruteforcing ssh with hydra gives password for the user mike
```hydra -l mike -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.150.150.166 ssh -t 4```


let's login to the ssh server using the creds

we have both the FLAG35 & 36 respectively

### Privilege escalation

Running ```sudo -l``` shows that the user mike can run ALL comands with sudo

so, ```sudo su``` spawned us a root shell.




Thanks.
