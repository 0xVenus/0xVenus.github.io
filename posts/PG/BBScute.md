let's begin the enumeration from port 80

we saw apache index page on port 80
![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/e45e1011-af4f-4910-841d-538c04651816)

viewing the source doesn't reveal anything. So let's proceed to directory brute forcing using ffuf

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/d1a11d14-7084-44c4-bc04-2b3543dd511f)

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  -u http://192.168.163.128/FUZZ
```
so, lets check the *index.php* directory first

we're presented with this page below

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/05f2d94e-04d6-4956-8163-dbea94a4e559)

so, let's search for possible exploits for the software version i marked above in the pics (cuteNews 2.1.2)

i got this [exploit](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/cve-2019-11447)

so, we need to have an account for us to be able to use the exploit

moving on to the registration page and let's try to register an account.

as you can see there's no captcha value to enter 

but viewing the source revealed the captcha directory

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/c4ede2a0-02c0-4f0f-bf11-ddb39c1c250f)

going over to the captcha directory showed the captcha value

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/b6cceaa3-734a-4045-b30a-46973ed1941c)

let's complete our registration.

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/17666628-16f1-40e1-b735-78e793134918)
we are now authenticated so let's use the exploit again since we've gotten login credentials

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/ac6650fa-3764-4204-b944-2f41f8c8e5cb)

we got bunches of errors due to the target hostname we provided

tho it's shows the target hostname so let's add it to our /etc/hosts file and run the exploit again

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/a281cb4a-82e0-488a-b15f-92c89d0b9592)

And yeh we gained foothold on the machine

so  finding the user flag using the find command as specified in the above pics gave the user flag.

### Privilege escalation


i used bash to get a proper revershell (tty shell)

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/6b36f57a-5c3e-4391-ab26-401c9531a79e)

so checking for suid binary shows we can run hping3 as root

![image](https://github.com/0xVenus/0xVenus.github.io/assets/97831939/f855eff5-5425-4d71-90ab-e1a1b07f22ef)

so lets check gtfo bins for the payloads to use in abusing the SUID binary.


using ``` /usr/sbin/hping3 then /bin/bash/ -p ``` gives us root.

Thanks and have a nice day.
